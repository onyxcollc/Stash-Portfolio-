 ## Background 

The goal of this project is to analyze my personal portfolio and compare it agianst NASDAQ to visually see how it would perform over the next the next 5yrs. If the performance shows positive growth I can confidently advice a new investor that this would be a solid group of ETF's to invest in.

## Plan

To provide a profitable portfolio I need to accomplish six main tasks:

1. [Data Modeling](#Data-Modeling): Clean the data, merge columns of the personal portfolio  and also make sure time stamps match up on my data frames.

2. [Performance Analysis](#Performance-Analysis): Run both data frames with Montecarlo Simulation to forcast a 5 year projection of a possible investment of $10,000.

3. [Visualization](#Visualization): Calculate the cumulative returns and visualize the data for both data frames then compare the cumulative returns of both data frames and determine the perfomrance overtime.
